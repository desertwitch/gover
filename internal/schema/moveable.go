// Moveable is the principal structure for all candidates to be moved. It can
// either be a filesystem element that is a file, link or empty folder.
// Non-empty folder structures are recorded within the [Moveable] for
// recreation.
//
// Moveables are meant to be passed by reference (pointer) and are not
// thread-safe.
//
// By design a [Moveable] and its subelements are entirely autonomous and can be
// processed independently of other [Moveable] elements, their directory
// structures and other fields.
